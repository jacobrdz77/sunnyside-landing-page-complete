### What I learned

First and foremost, this is the first project that I used Javascript(even though I don't really know how to use it to control the DOM yet).

CSS
I learned how to use/create variables for the first time and that really helped me on not repeating the font sizes. Looking back, I could've used it for the colors as well. This project also helped me practice Flexbox and Grid layouts. Another concept I learned is using position:aboslute. Reason being, I had to place elements above the header image which really threw me off for a couple of days.
